Chico Youth Court offers a juvenile justice alternative that is operated by youth.Chico Youth Court works with middle and high school teens who are first time offenders of misdemeanor or lesser crimes in Butte County.  We offer the offending youth a second chance via restorative justice, positive peer interaction and personal growth opportunities.  Emphasis is placed on maintaining respectful treatment of offenders and victims.  Participating youth learn about making responsible choices and accepting the consequences for their actions.  Recidivism rates are low, so there is less crime and less money lost in having to process the youth offenders through the juvenile court system.
